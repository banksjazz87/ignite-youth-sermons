# **Don’t Go In There!**

### Introduction

Have you ever been to someone’s house and seen a closet door that was shut tight? Maybe you asked what was inside, and they said, *“Don’t go in there!”* Why? Because behind that door is a mess they don’t want anyone to see—shoes scattered, old toys piled up, maybe laundry shoved in just to make the living room look nice when company came.

We do the same thing in our lives. We try to “shut the door” on our struggles, sins, or secrets. On the outside, we look put together—especially when we come to church—but inside, behind closed doors, there are things we don’t want anyone to know about.

But here’s the truth: **God sees what’s behind the closet door of our hearts.** He cares about what’s private just as much as what’s public.

### **Point 1: God Sees the Hidden Things**

**Scripture: Luke 12:2-3 (NIV)**  
*“There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.”*

We may think no one knows what’s behind our “closet door,” but Jesus reminds us—what’s hidden always comes to light. God isn’t trying to embarrass us; He wants us to deal with those things so they don’t destroy us later.

Think of it this way: if you never clean out the closet, it just gets messier and messier until eventually, the door bursts open.

### **Point 2: Integrity Means Being the Same in Private and Public**

**Scripture: Proverbs 10:9 (NIV)**  
*“Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.”*

Integrity means being the same person whether people are watching or not. If you’re kind at church but cruel online, that’s a “closet.” If you worship God on Sunday but look at things you shouldn’t on Monday, that’s a “closet.”

God is calling us to live with integrity—no hidden rooms, no locked doors. When we’re the same in private and in public, we walk securely. We don’t have to worry about getting caught or exposed, because there’s nothing hidden.

### **Point 3: Let Jesus Clean the Closet**

**Scripture: 1 John 1:9 (NIV)**  
*“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”*

Here’s the good news: **Jesus isn’t afraid of our mess.** He doesn’t say, *“Don’t go in there.”* He says, *“Let Me in there.”*

Confession is like opening the closet door and saying, *“Okay, God, here’s the mess.”* And when we do that, He doesn’t shame us—He forgives us. He cleans, restores, and gives us freedom.

The enemy wants us to keep the door shut and live with guilt and fear. But Jesus wants us to live in the light, with nothing to hide.

### **Closing Challenge**

So, what’s in your closet? What’s the thing you’ve been hiding? Tonight, Jesus is inviting you to open the door. Don’t wait until the mess explodes. Don’t let secret sins rob you of peace.

Be the same person in private as you are in public. Walk in integrity. And let Jesus into every corner of your life.

## **Discussion Questions**

1. Why do you think people try to keep certain things hidden from others—or from God?  
2. What’s the difference between reputation (what people think of you) and integrity (who you really are)?  
3. How does it feel to know that God already sees everything behind your “closet door”?  
4. Why do you think confession and honesty are so important in our walk with Jesus?  
5. What’s one area of your life where you could let Jesus “clean out the closet” and bring freedom?
